    cube.html - Demonstrates rendering and animation of simple cube objects

    GOAL Display a stack of three cubes, differently colored. The top cube
        can be rotated left or right in 90-degree increments using the two
        buttons on the page. Clicking a button should trigger a smooth
        animation of the top cube rotating to its new orientation; that is,
        we increment the angle a little each frame until a full 90-degree
        rotation is completed, at which point the angle no longer increments
        and the animation stops. Clicking either button while the top cube
        is currently animating should ideally do nothing; that is, buttons
        are effectively disabled until animation stops (how you do this is
        up to you). If you are unable to get the smooth animation working,
        then at least have the buttons trigger the appropriate 90-degree
        rotation as a single step. 

    TODO There are various smaller todo items throughout the three source
        files for this assignment. In addition, as described above, you must
        decide how to manage the start and stop of each animation sequence.
        Depending on your approach, this will likely require one or more
        new functions rather than simply modifying existing functions.
